What is RiftAI?

RiftAI is an interactive Python program designed to teach the basics of coding through a narrative-driven experience. It merges education with storytelling, turning dry syntax into something engaging and unforgettable.



Whether you're 12 or 42, RiftAI lets you learn variables, loops, and functions inside a universe that feels alive.

Why It Matters

RiftAI is proof that tech can be emotional, educational, and original. As a developer and storyteller, I designed this to feel like a conversation, not a classroom. And it works.



I believe in merging utility with creativity. RiftAI is my answer to a dull tutorial culture—and it’s just the beginning.
